            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a research scientist and manager at Snap Research, where I lead a team of research scientists, engineers and interns on academic, applied research, and engineering initiatives in user modeling and personalization across Snapchat.  I am especially interested in pushing forward the state-of-the-art in machine learning algorithms and applications on large-scale graph data. My work broadly spans the machine learning, data mining, network science, computational social science and software engineering domains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before I joined Snap, I defended my PhD thesis in the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Science
                Department</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I
                worked on discovering and modeling various types of abusive online behaviors as anomaly detection
                problems in large networks. I was very fortunate to have been advised by <a
                    href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/">Christos Faloutsos</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to this, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/">Department
                of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a>. There, I worked with <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/nfsamato">Nagiza Samatova</a> on 
                reduction, indexing and storage systems for large-scale scientific data.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you would like to learn more about my work, take a look at my <a href="publications.html">publications</a>
                and <a href="cv/vita.pdf">CV</a>.  Please reach out to me via my personal e-mail for consulting inquiries.
